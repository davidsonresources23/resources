Many cases of sexual violence go unreported, due to fear of retaliation from the abuser; the long, taxing, and re-traumatizing nature of the Title IX process; the need to go through the police; and the frequent refusal to provide supportive and necessary measures to survivors, such as removal of an abuser from on-campus housing or class. As Davidson students, we are forced to live and work alongside known abusers who are free to navigate the space and continue perpetuating harm as they please while survivors must to restructure their lives, if they are able, in order to feel some semblance of safety. Previously, Patterson Court Council organizations were entitled to a “blacklist,” a list of people composed by the members of the organization and private to the public who were not welcome within the organization's space because they had made members or others feel unsafe. Davidson College has since banned the use of the blacklist for the legal purposes of protecting the anonymity of accused abusers. In doing this, the college stripped students of one of the few protective measures we could take to prevent harm and protect ourselves and our friends. Davidson College and the Title IX office have failed time and time again to protect students from harm and offer support and solidarity to those who have been harmed already. ");
